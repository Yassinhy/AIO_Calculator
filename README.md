# General-Purpose Calculator (Built from Scratch)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a fully functional general-purpose calculator entirely from scratch. Unlike typical calculators that rely on built-in floating-point arithmetic, this software will feature a custom numerical system optimized for high precision and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to provide an advanced yet intuitive tool for scientific and engineering calculations.

## Goals
The calculator will support:

### 1. **Base Conversions**
   - Convert numbers between different bases (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Custom Bases).
   - Support for arbitrary precision when converting between bases.

### 2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Modular arithmetic for advanced number theory applications.
   - Support for both fixed-point and floating-point computations.

### 3. **Fundamental Mathematical Functions**
   - Square roots and higher-order roots.
   - Power functions with full precision.
   - Factorials, logarithms, and exponentials.
   
### 4. **Scientific Constants & Unit Conversions**
   - A database of fundamental constants such as π, e, Planck’s constant, and more.
   - Convert between different measurement units (e.g., length, mass, time, temperature).

### 5. **Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions**
   - Sin, Cos, Tan, and their inverses.
   - Hyperbolic functions (Sinh, Cosh, Tanh, etc.).
   - Optimized implementations using series expansion and lookup tables for speed.

### 6. **Equation Solver**
   - Solve linear and non-linear equations.
   - Support for polynomial roots and higher-degree equations.
   - Future expansion to systems of equations.

### 7. **Calculus Operations**
   - **Derivative Calculator:** Compute derivatives symbolically and numerically.
   - **Integral Calculator:** Perform definite and indefinite integrals.
   - Support for step-by-step solutions and approximation methods.

## Development Plan
To achieve these goals, the calculator will be developed in multiple phases:
1. **Implementing a custom numerical system** (avoiding standard floating-point errors by designing a specialized format).
2. **Building a library of mathematical functions** with optimized precision.
3. **Developing an interactive command-line interface** for user input and computations.
4. **Expanding to a graphical user interface (GUI)** in later stages for ease of use.

## Why Build from Scratch?
Many existing calculators rely on standard floating-point arithmetic, which introduces rounding errors and precision limitations. This project will push the boundaries of numerical accuracy by implementing a custom arithmetic system, ensuring precision for complex calculations.

## Future Plans
- Implement symbolic computation for algebraic expressions.
- Develop an AI-based function simplifier.
- Add graphing capabilities for functions and equations.
- Support for parallel computation using SIMD for performance improvements.
